{% block title %} Application Form {% endblock %}

{% block content %}

<!-- your html goes here -->
<!-- 
Add to the HTML document application-form.html so that it has the following items.

A form that asks the user:
Their first and last name (as separate fields),
Their salary requirement as a number, and
Which job they are applying for, from a list of:
Software Engineer
QA Engineer
Product Manager
The form should also have a submit button that submits the form to the URL path /application. This should be a POST request. (For now, just focus on the HTML requirements for this request. Donâ€™t build a Flask route, yet.)
The page should have a large heading and some explanatory text, as well.
Add the elements to make your HTML form accessible to screen readers. For more information, see http://webaim.org/techniques/forms/controls.

She is asking different psychics about every Hackbrighter's future, and needs to know a little more about you to run her experiments. To figure out if the psychic is really thinking of you or if the psychic has their brain-wires crossed, please enter the following information (only Balloonicorn will see this)</p>
